        <h1 class="card-title">What is Glassmorphism?</h1>
        <p>Glassmorphism is a style which, as the name implies, uses properties of glass to enhance your designs. It gives a translucent or transparent look and feel to its elements. Glassmorphic elements and shapes work really well on vibrant, colorful backgrounds which accentuate the glass effect.</p>
        <p>Glassmorphism helps you add visual hierarchy to your designs and puts focus on the content you want to highlight. Glass designs aren't the best if you're designing for people who have vision problems. You'll have to be very careful when choosing colors and fonts to make sure screen readers and other devices can properly interpret the designs.‌‌ Also, using glassmorphism can cause your site to become slow and can also increase battery usage.</p>
